# My Sofle ZMK Config

## Keymap

## Considerations

- I browse with my right hand on my trackpad and left hand on my left split, so I want my left split to be function-heavy. This meant full numpad and Fn layers so I don't have to move my right hand apart from typing text.
- Is a LCTRL and LALT required for Mac? Just use RCTRL and RALT together with right keys for arrow keys/movement.
- Is alt enter the "alternative" enter in Mac? If so, can experiment with tap dance enter = alt enter.

## Todo

- I don't really get homerow mods apart from Shift, but Shift would have quite a few false positives.
- I might try autoshift on top of caps word and get rid of the LSHFT hold (change to hold for num layer?).
- Find useful encoder functions (e.g. moving by words).
- Multimeter to fix my left split keys.
